## AAE

As a User Experience Coordinator at the Emory Office of Advancement and Alumni Engagement, my responsibilities include streamlining data management tasks for the user experience team. Since the data is comprised of personal information about alumni, I cannot publish them in this repository. However, the Python scripts I wrote to perform certain tasks on the data can be found here. In lieu of the original data, I will be creating "dummy" files for which the scripts can be initiated.

### ID Matching, September 23/24, 2020 (*id_matching.py*): 

Emory University has a database of all Emory affiliates with unique identification numbers (hereafter referred to as IDs) to distinguish between them. In the Emory Alumni Association Online Community, alumni can update their personal information without logging in to their alumni accounts. In such cases, the resulting changes cannot be reflected in the database because IDs are not "tied" to the updates. In contrast, changes made my alumni who log in beforehand are automatically updated in the database. Given a master file of 150,000 + active alumni containing all identifiable information, the goal was to find the "missing" IDs of alumni who update their personal information online by cross-referencing their names and email addresses with the master file.
